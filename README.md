# Teaching Website Backend
The backend for my teaching website.

## Next steps
- Create script / run config to purge dev services (need to remove volume to have the init script(s) be run again, in case of changes).
- Introduce an ORM and connect to DB.
- Introduce passport.js and set up a first authenticated endpoint (username / password)
